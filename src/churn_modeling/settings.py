# Set up the session storeÂ¶
# In the domain of experiment tracking, each pipeline run is considered a session. 
# A session store records all related metadata for each pipeline run, from logged 
# metrics to other run-related data such as timestamp, git username and branch. 
# The session store is a SQLite database that is generated during your first pipeline 
# run after it has been set up in your project.




# To use kedro-viz for experimental tracking:
# from kedro_viz.integrations.kedro.sqlite_store import SQLiteStore
# from pathlib import Path
# SESSION_STORE_CLASS = SQLiteStore
# SESSION_STORE_ARGS = {"path": str(Path(__file__).parents[2] / "data")}
